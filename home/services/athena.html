                <B>Federated query</B> in Athena allows you to run SQL queries across variety of relational,
                non-relational, and custom data sources. You get a unified way to run SQL queries across various data
                stores.

                You can use the <B>Athena Query Federation SDK</B> to write your UDF (User defined function). You can
                upload your function to AWS Lambda and then invoke it in your Athena query.

                Federated query - SQL queries across a variety of data stores (proprietary or custom databases using
                connectors).Connectors run as AWS Lambda functions in the customer account. Each connector is composed
                of two Lambda functions specific to a data source â€“ one for metadata, and one for record reading.

                When you create a new table schema in Amazon Athena the schema is stored in the <B>Data Catalog</B> and
                used when executing queries, but it does not modify your data in S3. Athena uses an approach known as
                schema-on-read, which allows you to project your schema onto your data at the time you execute a query.
                This eliminates the need for any data loading or transformation

                Athena SQL queries can invoke ML models deployed on Amazon SageMaker. However it can not use other
                services such as Comprehend, Forecasting or Models deployed on my own EC2 cluster. Athena offers ML
                inference (prediction) capabilities wrapped by a SQL interface. You can also call an
                <B>Athena user-defined function (UDF)</B> to invoke pre- or post-processing logic on your result set.You
                can run inference in the Select phase or in the Filter phase.

                Athena uses <B>Presto</B> when you run SQL queries on Amazon S3. Presto is an open source, in-memory,
                distributed SQL engine, and can handle complex analysis, including large joins, window functions, and
                arrays.

                Amazon Athena allows you to partition your data on any column. Partitions allow you to limit the amount
                of data each query scans, leading to cost savings and faster performance. You can
                <B>specify your partitioning scheme using the PARTITIONED BY clause in the CREATE TABLE statement</B>
